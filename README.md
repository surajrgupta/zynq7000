## Course Description

***Note: Take this course if you want save money in training costs of similar contents. The Official Xilinx Traning Courses cost typically from 600 USD to 4000 USD. This course is not only teaches the Zynq Processing System (PS) but also the Programmable Logic (FPGA), and the interface between them.***

- ***Published (20 Apr 2019): The GCD accelerator and UART sections will be added later, and the course price will be increased, when those sections are added.***

- ***Update 1 (22 Apr 2019): English Subtitles/CCs are enabled for this course***

- ***Update 2 (02 Jan 2020): Add bonus lecture.***


### What is AXI?
Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) is an industry-standard, system bus for the connection between CPU and peripheral in System-on-Chip (SoC) design. Today AXI version 4 (AXI4) is used in many SoC that use ARM Cortex-A processors, such as Qualcomm Snapdragon, Samsung Exynos, Broadcom (used on Raspberry Pi), and many more.

### What is ZYNQ?
ZYNQ is actually a SoC, not just a FPGA, because ZYNQ consists of hard processor system (ARM Cortex-A9) and programmable logic (Xilinx 7-series FPGA, equivalent to Artix-7 FPGA). The ZYNQ device enables the implementation of custom logic such as hardware accelerator in combination with software that runs on the ARM Cortex-A9. ZYNQ can also run Linux OS, which makes this device like the popular Raspberry Pi, but with FPGA inside.
